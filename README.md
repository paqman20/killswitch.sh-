# killswitch.sh-
this is kill switch for a vpn all you have to do is connect to your VPN server and get your IP Address then after that plug that is and BOOM you now have a kill switch your VPN goes down and your internet connection goes down with it. 



There is are two things you must do FRIST before you run the script.

#1 You must find the inet addres of your device this is nneded. This is very simeple to add and find all you should need to do is run ip addr | grep inet  it should be the third one down with a brd next to the end. So go ahead and add this to script where the # are infront of the two identical ip addr 

#2 find the ip address of the server you can do this very easily by just typing "What is my ip" and plug that in when it says so. 

Then you should be good to go if you have any questions feel free to reach out im new and this was pretty hard for me but im sure we could work something out
